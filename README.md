# Bachelor source codes
This repository contains four different project, each with their own unique purpose and set of scripts.

## Factory Solution
The factory-solution project contains source code for two different industrial scenarios: assembly-line and automatic warehouse. 

## Attacks
The attacks project focuses on implementing attacks on Modbus TCP networks, that are implemented in factory-solution. Modbus TCP is a commonly used protocol in industrial control systems, and this project is designed to help identify and prevent potential attacks against these networks. The scripts within this project are designed to simulate attacks and help security professionals identify vulnerabilities and potential security risks.

## Anomaly Detection
The anomaly-detection project is focused on implementing three different statistical methods for detecting anomalies using IPFIX records. These methods are designed to detect and flag data points that fall outside of normal parameters or patterns. 

## Unipi-config
The unipi-config project contains a collection of scripts that are used for initializing and configuring Unipi PLC devices. These devices are commonly used in industrial automation and control systems, and the scripts in this project can help simplify the setup process and ensure that the devices are properly configured.
